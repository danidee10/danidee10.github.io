django-notifs is not just another notifications app for django. It's the only django library that supports in-app notifications and at the same time ***allows you broadcast these notifications via email, SMS, Slack, push notifications and any other means you can think of through custom backends***.

Even through websockets so you can build a Realtime notification system.

I wrote a tutorial on how it can be used in conjunction with `Vue.js`, `RabbitMQ` and `uWSGI` websockets to [build a Chat application](https://danidee10.github.io/2018/01/01/realtime-django-1.html)

<!-- It also features an API for that decouples it from django. This means you can use it to send and manage notifications no matter the language/stack you use.
From PHP to NodeJS Webapps, Background tasks/workers, CLI/Shell Scripts even mobile Applications
